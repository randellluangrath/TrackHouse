# TrackHouse
Hello.

This website was created to count the number of times Kanye West has used a word across all of his songs. The data will display in the form of a table <= 50 words.

My inspiration for this website came from the creators of the KanyeREST API. That is where I obtained my content from.

Though the API offered both a sorted text file of lyrics and unsorted text file of lyrics, I decided to grab the raw file and sort it myself using Java. I've included both raw file and my sorted and formatted lyrics file.

For actual table view funcationality on the website you will <b>NEED</b> to import the trackhouse_db.sql file into your own DB. Super important because this part of the website is the beef.

If you have any questions or critiques on how I can improve my practice, please feel free to message me.
